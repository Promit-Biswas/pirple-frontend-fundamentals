## Homework Assignment #4: Basic Styling

Let's go back to your recipe (from assignments #1, #2, and #3), and add some styling to it.

1. Change the background color of the entire page (choose any color you wish)
2. Change the font size of the paragraphs and lists so they are different sizes.
3. Add padding below each heading (h1, h2 etc) you've used, to space them out from the content they're above.
4. Make the page title (the h1) bold, and make it underlined.
