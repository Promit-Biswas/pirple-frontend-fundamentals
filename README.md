## Homework Assignment #2: Images

It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.

1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
3. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. Download them from your favorite emoji website and then upload them somewhere so you can link to them on your HTML page.
4. Below your final list, add another paragraph that describes what the dish should look, smell, and taste like when it's all done.
