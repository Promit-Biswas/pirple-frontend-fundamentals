## Project 2

Let's return to the favorite-book project you completed for project #1. Now it's time to add some styling to that page as well.

1. Look up a "css reset" stylesheet, and import it into your page to normalize all the styles.

2. Pick one of the websites websites from below to model your page's style after. You don't need to make your site look exactly like one of these, just try to emulate the style of their fonts, buttons, menu, and overall feel.

-   [ ] HackerNews (news.ycombinator.com)

-   [ ] VentureBeat
-   [ ] Airbnb

-   [ ] Youtube
-   [ ] Twitter

### Extra Credit:

1. Using your favorite drawing program (we recommend Inkscape or Gimp) create a logo for your site, and add it to an upper corner of your page.
2. Add a menu to your site. The menu should include links but the links don't have to actually lead anywhere.
