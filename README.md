# PRIPLE Course: Frontend Fundamentals

Repository for the course: https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/frontend-fundamentals

The master branch represents the summerization of the entire course. Each of the 6 homework assignements and 2 projects has a separate branch if you want to see it in isolation.

### Finalized Products:

Whilst there are multiple assignemnts over the course some of them are not a good representation of the final products, due to the progressive nature of the course. The final products are as follows: 

- **Homework Assignment #6** - A responsive website representing a recipe for cooking Greek Sauerkraut
- **Project #2** - A facebook-design inspired "story" of our choosing

## Project Tasks:

### Homework Assignment #1: Lists

What's your favorite food? Do you know how to make it yourself? If not, look up the recipe online. Next, create an HTML document, and within the body of the page, create two lists:

1. The first list should be an unordered list of all the ingredients needed to make the dish.
2. The second list should be an ordered list, detailing the steps you need to take to prepare that dish.

#### Extra Credit:

For extra credit, add comments to your HTML, to explain the purpose of each section of code that you create.

### Homework Assignment #2: Images

It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.

1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual &lt;h1&gt; title on the page.
2. Below the &lt;h1&gt;, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
3. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. Download them from your favorite emoji website and then upload them somewhere so you can link to them on your HTML page.
4. Below your final list, add another paragraph that describes what the dish should look, smell, and taste like when it's all done.

#### Extra Credit:

Below the final paragraph on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the final product should look like.

### Homework Assignment #3: Links

It's time to compare your recipe to the recipes of others. Find the 5 best recipes for your dish from around the web. Now, add a list to the bottom of your document that links to each of those recipes.

#### Extra Credit:

So far your page is fairly unstructured (just lists, paragraphs and one title). Spruce it up a little by adding section-headings and extra elements to make the recipe more helpful to your readers. Get creative, add any elements you feel would help the user really understand the recipe and the dish itself.

### Project 1

We didn't cover all the possible HTML tags yet. What are they? And what should they be used for? For this project you should:

1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

##### Note: CSS is intentionally left out, that is part of project #2

### Homework Assignment #4: Basic Styling

Let's go back to your recipe (from assignments #1, #2, and #3), and add some styling to it.

1. Change the background color of the entire page (choose any color you wish)
2. Change the font size of the paragraphs and lists so they are different sizes.
3. Add padding below each heading (h1, h2 etc) you've used, to space them out from the content they're above.
4. Make the page title (the h1) bold, and make it underlined.

#### Extra Credit:

1. Find a website that lists out all the various css properties you can use, and send that link to us when you submit your assignment.
2. Using that website as a resource, add a styling property that we haven't covered yet.

### Homework Assignment #5: Classes and IDs

1. Refactor (aka rewrite / reorganize) your code from assignment #4 so that more than 75% of your CSS is selecting elements by classes and IDs.
2. Give your ordered list and unordered list unique classes.
3. If you haven't yet, find a resource online that explains all the different CSS properties you can use in your website.
4. Change the bullet-points in the unordered list so that they are an emoji of your choosing.
5. Change the numbers in the ordered list so that they are roman numerals instead.

#### Extra Credit:

1. Within one of your paragraphs, add <span> elements around several words or phrases that should be emphasized.
2. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply to <span> elements that are within <p> elements, and make them italic.
3. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply the last <span> within a <p> tag, and make it underlined.
4. Give the first <span> element within the <p> tag a special class. Now add CSS that will remove the italics and apply a red color instead.

### Homework Assignment #6: Responsiveness

It's time to make your recipe a bit more mobile friendly.

1. Using a combination of HTML and CSS changes, modify your recipe site so that it works well on mobile devices of all sizes.
2. Within your browser's dev-tools, simulate different screen sizes so that you can check your work.

#### Extra Credit:

1. Look up the css "media" rule, and learn how to apply special styles to different browser sizes.
2. Using one media rule, target all browsers smaller than 400px
3. Using another media rule, target all browsers between 401px and 750px;
4. Using another media rule, target all browsers larger than 750px.
5. Add special styles to each media screen to enhance responsiveness (adjust font sizes, colors, hide and show content, etc).

### Project 2

Let's return to the favorite-book project you completed for project #1. Now it's time to add some styling to that page as well.

1. Look up a "css reset" stylesheet, and import it into your page to normalize all the styles.

2. Pick one of the websites websites from below to model your page's style after. You don't need to make your site look exactly like one of these, just try to emulate the style of their fonts, buttons, menu, and overall feel.
