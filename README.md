## Homework Assignment #3: Links

It's time to compare your recipe to the recipes of others. Find the 5 best recipes for your dish from around the web. Now, add a list to the bottom of your document that links to each of those recipes.

### Extra Credit:

So far your page is fairly unstructured (just lists, paragraphs and one title). Spruce it up a little by adding section-headings and extra elements to make the recipe more helpful to your readers. Get creative, add any elements you feel would help the user really understand the recipe and the dish itself.
